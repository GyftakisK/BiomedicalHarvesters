This repository contains indepentent projects for harvesting knowledge from different biomedical resources into colletions of MongoDB in a form of relations between concepts.

In particular three harvesters are available:
1. The [Litrature Harvester](https://github.com/tasosnent/BiomedicalHarvesters/tree/master/HarvestEntrez) to retrieve online articles relevant to a MeSH term from PubMed and PMC through the Entrez Programming Utilities. 
2. The [OBO Harvester](https://github.com/tasosnent/BiomedicalHarvesters/tree/master/HarvestOBO) to process the OBO files of biomedical ontologies.
3. The [DrugBank Harvester](https://github.com/tasosnent/BiomedicalHarvesters/tree/master/HarvestDrugBank) to process the XML file of DrugBank.
